    IMPORTANT:
    - Policy elements can appear only within the <inbound>, <outbound>, <backend> section elements.
    - Only the <forward-request> policy element can appear within the <backend> section element.
    - To apply a policy to the incoming request (before it is forwarded to the backend service), place a corresponding policy element within the <inbound> section element.
    - To apply a policy to the outgoing response (before it is sent back to the caller), place a corresponding policy element within the <outbound> section element.
    - To add a policy position the cursor at the desired insertion point and click on the round button associated with the policy.
    - To remove a policy, delete the corresponding policy statement from the policy document.
    - Policies are applied in the order of their appearance, from the top down.
